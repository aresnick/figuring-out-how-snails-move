`figuring-out-how-a-snail-moves` is a small, one-day project resulting from a workshop [Molly Josephs](https://mollyj.org) put together on 2 August 2017.  You can see the current, rough draft at [http://figuring-out-how-snails-move.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/](http://figuring-out-how-snails-move.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Overview (excerpted from [`v0.1`](http://figuring-out-how-snails-move.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#overview)

N.B. This is an attempt to explain, in simple terms, how land snails move. After hanging out with some snails for an hour, this is what I came up with. So it's just my attempt to understand and describe how a snail moves, combining analogy and direct observation, informed by reading some of the literature out there on the topic.

If you find any mistakes in this, please drop me a line at [`alec@powderhouse.org`](mailto:alec@powderhouse.org). This is my first and only attempt to understand how snails move, much less to write it up, and more expert perspective would be very much appreciated.

[Molly](http://mollyj.org) recently started ["Snailophilia"](http://mollyj.org/projects/snails.html), a project where she is admiring, investigating, and documenting the activity of snails.

Molly asked us to play around with observing and thinking about how snails work as part of the development of our programs of study for Powderhouse Studios.  Briefly, her goals with us were to:

-   …develop ideas for how to structure observations, documentation, storytelling, and explanations of animal behaviors
-   …brainstorm ideas for activities Molly would do during programs she ran around her program of study

So in those veins, we hung out for about an hour outside of sprout's studios in Davis Square and watched a few snails Molly found. Then I took some time to read and think about how snails move, and put together this project.
